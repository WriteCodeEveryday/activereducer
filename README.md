# Activereducer
Activereducer is the one-stop shop for setting up automated reductions for Production databases. Don't risk heavy HIPAA or BSA Compliance fines, just setup ActiveReducer and use it to generate perfectly reduced databases for your QA, UAT, Demo and Training environments.

## Usage
Once I write the thing, I will fill this section in, I promise.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activereducer'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

## Contributing
It's an open source repo, fork the thing, make some changes, and I'll put you on the list of cool people making code great again.

## License
The gem is available as open source under the CC0 terms.
